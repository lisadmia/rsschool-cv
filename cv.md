## About Me ##

During my life, I tried to do different things. After college, I did not continue my studies in architecture, but decided to try myself in game development, but I felt that it was not for me. After that, having an architectural education, I worked in a layout workshop, where I made layouts of different sizes, dealt with small details and even printed on a 3d printer. However, I wanted to do something that would be more in demand in our progressive future, namely programming.  
I started my way into programming with Cybersecurity, but it turned out to be not as interesting as I thought. In the end, I came to the frontend, because it combines what I want to do - programming, and what I love - creativity. I hope to become a great developer in the future and love this business with all my might.
